# Randomizer

At work we always had problems deciding where to go for lunch.  Created first instance as a regular shell script but then decided to make it python and go one step further and use curses.

## Features

* Creates suspense by slowly counting up to a number instead of instantly picking something.
* The target number changes with the number of items added so it always last around the same time.

## Caveats

* The base target number is hard coded, and some machines run much faster than others.
* This was one of the first python scripts I made, so it needs to be refactored now that I know how to do things properly.
